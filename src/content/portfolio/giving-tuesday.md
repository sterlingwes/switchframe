 #GivingTuesday connects diverse groups of people,
                              communities and organizations around the world
                              with a common purpose of inspiring and encouraging
                              giving. PayPal has been a lead supporter of the
                              movement since the beginning and is teaming up
                              with #GivingTuesday partners globally to do
                              something positive and historic – break a Guinness
                              World Records™ title for giving.
