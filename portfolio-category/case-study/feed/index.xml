Last year in Ontario, more than 2,500 volunteers drove approximately 11.8 million kilometres to help almost 14,000 patients.</p>
<p>Since the mid 1950&#8217;s the Canadian Cancer Society has provided volunteer driver transportation assistance for people with cancer. Volunteer drivers provide return trips for patients from their home to treatment centres. They offer friendly support and kindness at a time when patients need it most.</p>
<p>About 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime. For many Canadians, getting to their life-saving treatment appointments will be a challenging feat. 1 in 5 cancer patients in Ontario have trouble getting to their treatment appointments.</p>
<p>In Ontario, through its Wheels of Hope patient transportation program, the Canadian Cancer Society matches volunteer drivers with cancer patients who need help getting to treatment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation of Canada is the only national organization solely dedicated to fighting Polycystic Kidney Disease through research, education, advocacy, support and awareness. Our goal is simple – to discover treatments and a cure for Polycystic Kidney Disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arie was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) when he was 21 years old. He has since received a kidney transplant from a donor match and friend. Arie and his family live in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheri Barton was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 13 years ago after mutating the gene. Due to her enlarged liver, she is constantly asked if she is pregnant and can only wear maternity clothing. Cheri and her family live in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luisa Miniaci-Di Leo a été diagnostiquée de la maladie polykystique autosomique dominante (MPRAD) en 1989 après de nombreuses fausses-couches. Elle a depuis dû cesser de travailler et vit avec plusieurs complications causées par le gonflement de son foie qui créé une pression sur son abdomen. Cela a aussi des conséquences sur ses fonctions respiratoires et digestives.</p>
