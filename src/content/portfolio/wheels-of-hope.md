 The Canadian Cancer Society’s Wheels of Hope
                              program pairs volunteer drivers with cancer
                              patients to give them rides to and from treatment.
                              Last year in Ontario, more than 2,500 volunteers
                              drove approximately 11.8 million kilometres to
                              help almost 14,000 patients.

 Since the mid 1950’s the Canadian Cancer
                              Society has provided volunteer driver
                              transportation assistance for people with cancer.
                              Volunteer drivers provide return trips for
                              patients from their home to treatment centres.
                              They offer friendly support and kindness at a time
                              when patients need it most.

 About 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in
                              their lifetime. For many Canadians, getting to
                              their life-saving treatment appointments will be a
                              challenging feat. 1 in 5 cancer patients in
                              Ontario have trouble getting to their treatment
                              appointments.

 In Ontario, through its Wheels of Hope patient
                              transportation program, the Canadian Cancer
                              Society matches volunteer drivers with cancer
                              patients who need help getting to treatment.
